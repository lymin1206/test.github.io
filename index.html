			<p>    <em>Introduction </em></p>  
				<p1> Hi all, I am Lie Meng. I obtained my PhD degree from Engineering faculty 
				     of University Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) in 2018. Previously, I received my bachelor
			            degree from UNIMAS in 2012. Currently, I am a research associate at Southern Unviersity of Science
				and Technology (SUSTECH) with Professor Hisao Ishibuchi. <br> <br></p1>
			<p> <em> Research interests </em> </p>
			
				<p1> Fuzzy systems, soft computing, pattern recognition,
					evolutionary computation. <br> <br></p1>
